- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darius-Liesis
- 👀 I’m interested in studying the nuances of creating ideas and concepts using various Information Technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but willing to branch out to other languages after I master it, like PHP5, JavaScript, C++. Time will tell.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking to collaborate on anything, due to my beginner's level of skill. As I build confidence and mastery, time will tell.
